Introduction:
Agriculture continues to be a fundamental sector for ensuring food security and supporting economic development, particularly in developing countries such as Bangladesh. Despite its significance, farmers often face systemic challenges that hinder their ability to earn fair prices for their produce. One of the most critical issues is the presence of intermediaries who purchase crops from farmers at low prices and resell them at considerably higher rates. This not only reduces the profit margins of farmers but also contributes to artificial price inflation and market inefficiencies.
To address these challenges, this project proposes the development of a comprehensive digital platform that directly connects farmers, buyers, and government agricultural authorities (Krishi Odhidoptor). By eliminating third-party intermediaries, the platform aims to promote transparency, ensure fair pricing, and improve the economic conditions of farmers.
In addition to marketplace functionality, the platform incorporates several advanced, AI-powered features designed to empower farmers with real-time information, expert support, and digital literacy. Key features include:
A Bengali-speaking chatbot that provides personalized farming advice and enables direct communication with government agricultural experts.
Image-based pest and disease detection using computer vision techniques.
Voice input and output capabilities to support illiterate or semi-literate users.
An AI-powered FAQ system that offers accessible information on government subsidies, loans, and related programs.
Real-time, location-specific weather alerts.
Aggregation and translation of relevant agricultural news into Bengali.
Bengali-language micro-courses and tutorials on modern farming techniques.
Buyers can access farmer posts and submit their crop requirements, creating a two-way communication channel that fosters efficiency and fairness in the agricultural supply chain.
Through this initiative, the project seeks to build a technology-driven agricultural ecosystem that not only increases the incomes of farmers but also ensures a more stable and transparent market for all stakeholders involved.
Scope:
The scope of this project encompasses the design, development, and deployment of an AI-integrated digital platform that connects farmers, buyers, and government agricultural authorities (Krishi Odhidoptor) to create a transparent, efficient, and inclusive agricultural ecosystem.
The platform will address key challenges faced by farmers, such as low profitability, lack of access to expert advice, limited market visibility, and poor access to government schemes. Simultaneously, it will facilitate buyers in sourcing produce directly from farmers and enable the government to monitor, assist, and engage with farming communities more effectively.
Users and Their Roles
The platform is designed to support four primary user groups: Farmers, Buyers, Government Agricultural Authorities (Krishi Odhidoptor), and Platform Administrators. Each user type is provided with specific roles and permissions aligned with their responsibilities in the system to ensure efficient, secure, and user-centric platform operation.
1. Farmers
Farmers are the primary beneficiaries of the platform. Their roles include:
Registering and managing their profiles.
